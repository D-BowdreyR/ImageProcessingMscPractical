# Image Processing in Python

Code written for python practical I undertook during an MSc module "ICT in the Clinical Environment"

This includes some JN (Jupyter Notebook) Sessions to get warmed up using python and then a few image processing exercises.

The Image Processing parts include:

- Loading / Reading in DICOM files using pydicom
- Image processing (Window and Level and threshold)
- Image Registration
  - Manual Fusion
    - using keyboard events (up,down,left,right)
  - Automated Fusion
    - using optimisers and a cost function
